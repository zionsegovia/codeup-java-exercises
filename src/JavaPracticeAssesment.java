//# Java Assessment Practice Problems
//
//        1. Create a class called Practice with a main method.
//        2. Create a public static method in the Practice class called *subtractTen* that takes one integer argument and returns that number minus 10.
//        3. Create a public static method *average* in the Practice class that takes an array of integers and returns their average as a double.
//        4. Create a class called Pet with two String instance variables, name and type.
//        5. Create getters and setters for the properties as well as a constructor that takes two strings and sets the name and type.
//        6. Create a PetDog class that inherits from Pet.
//        7. In PetDog, create a boolean instance variable, trained.
//        8. Write a constructor for PetDog that sets its name, type, and trained properties.
//        9. Write an instance method in PetDog  called isTrained that returns the boolean value of the trained property.
//        10. Create an interface named Companion. The Companion interface should specify an instance method named snuggle that has no arguments and returns
//        a String. Change your PetDog
//        class so it implements the Companion interface. The implementation of the snuggle method on the PetDog class should return "name wants to snuggle", where name is the inherited instance property.
//        11. Create a PetDogTest class, instantiate a PetDog, and verify that the snuggle method works correctly.
//        12. In your Practice class, create a static method named multiplyAll. It should accept an integer and an ArrayList of integers. It should take the ArrayList argument and multiply all its elements
//        by the value of the integer argument. It should return an ArrayList of integers.
//        12b. In your PetDog class, create a static method named allSnuggle. It should accept an ArrayList of PetDog objects and
//        output the result of calling the snuggle method on all of them. Create an ArrayList with at least three PetDog instances in the PetDogTest class.
//        Call the allSnuggle method and pass it the ArrayList. Verify that the allSnuggle method works correctly.
